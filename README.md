This is the config package for running mendel-go on SPC.

To use this package, first install SPC from https://github.org/whbrewer/SPC

then run ./spc install https://github.org/whbrewer/mendel-go-spc/archive/master.zip

Note, you will need to get the mendel-go binary (not currently relaced), and
replace the current empty file called mendel-go with the mendel-go binary.
